Syllabus Winter 2018

+   <u>**Welcome**</u>

    Welcome to Computer Science Enrichment Club - Computer and Network Security Division. 

+   <u>Description</u>

    +   Meeting Time: Fridays 3pm - 5pm

    +   Meeting Place: IC326

    This semester will focus mainly on Web Applications and Computer Networks. There will be one hour of teaching and another for hands-on practicals. You are encouraged to bring your laptops with you. It is truly impossible to train you if you are not making any personal efforts. My job is to make you curious and provide a guideline but only your personal time and effort will take you from novice to pro. That being said, you are welcome to just watch and listen, but there is no fun in that :smile:

    Official meetings will be held based on attendance. That is, if according to the poll, most of you are unavailable, then the formal meeting will not be held (Basically, the sheduled topic and challenges will not be covered officially). However, I will pay close attention to regular attendees. These students will not be affected by this policy. They will cover accelerated material instead.

    Text (Recommended):
    
    1.  The Web Application Hackers Handbook

    2.  Hacking; the Art of Exploitation

    Online course (Recommended):

    3.  [Hacker101 by HackerOne](https://www.hacker101.com)

    Additional resources will be announced or posted as deemed necessary

+   <u>**Tutorial hour schedule**</u>

    During the tutorial hour (3pm - 4pm). We will discuss general topics in Web applications and Computer networks. Occassionally, there will be take-home challenges. No submission required. However, you are encouraged to attempt them. I will be available to answer questions regarding these challenges.

+   <u>**Practical hour schedule**</u>

    During the practical hour (4:10pm - 5pm). We will take on Natas challenges from OverTheWire.com. This will be more like a walk-through session. That is, I solve the challenges and explain my actions. Walk-throughs will be somewhat fast paced. However, you will be required to solve these same challenges and document your steps (with screenshots). I will deploy a submission system. Now, no pressure, this isn't grade or anything. This is a way of telling the serious ones. It is also a way of forcing me to do them all in preparation for the meetings. You are under no obligation to solve these challenges.

    To allow sometime for those doing the challenges, my solutions will be posted (and routable from this document) on git the following Friday.

    Feel free to solve these challenges on your own before the allocated times.
